<div class="intro">
<p>Out here, Up North, we explore vast lakes and the north woods. We find the best things in life are free or gently used.</p>

<p>We say funny things like “thanks” and “have a nice day.”</P>

<p>And we believe what’s old, is new again.</p>

<p> We’re inspired by vintage designs and 1960’s Americana.</p>

<p>At the Arcana we wouldn’t have it any other way. We love to hunt for discarded relics and bring them back to life.</P>

<p>Thank you for visiting. - The Arcana</p>
